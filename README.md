## **Project Description**

This project is a responsive café website created around the concept of **Beans & Bubbles**, a fictional café brand made for academic purposes. The goal of the website is to represent how a small café could present its services online in a simple, organized, and user-friendly way. Instead of just building random pages, we designed it as if we were preparing an actual website for a real client.

The main objective of this project is to **apply what we have learned** in **Web Application Development (WAD)** and **Responsive Web Design (RWD)**. We focused on clean layout design, basic interactivity using **JavaScript**, and making sure that the pages remain functional and readable on both computers and mobile devices.

Aside from the technical side, this project also allowed us to practice **team coordination, task division, maintaining a consistent design, and writing proper documentation**, all of which are important skills in real-world development. Through this activity, we experienced how front-end development progresses step by step: from planning and layout creation to review, polishing, and final presentation.

## **Project Overview**

The website includes several pages: **Home, About, Menu, Team, Reviews, and Contact**. Each page is kept clean and simple to make navigation easy and comfortable for users. We focused on readability, spacing, and a layout that feels natural and similar to how real café websites showcase their content.
